## What I Learned

This project was a great learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Bootstrap Framework**: I gained hands-on experience with Bootstrap's grid system and components, which greatly simplified the process of creating a responsive layout.

2. **jQuery Implementation**: I learned how to use jQuery to add interactivity, particularly for the scroll animations on the content cards.

3. **CSS Animations**: Implementing Animate.css taught me how to enhance user experience with subtle animations.

4. **Modal Implementation**: Creating the reservation modal helped me understand how to build interactive forms and pop-ups.

5. **Responsive Design**: I practiced creating a website that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. **Version Control**: This project allowed me to practice using Git and GitHub for version control and project management.

7. **Web Performance**: I learned about optimizing web performance by using CDNs for faster loading of external libraries.

## Challenges and Future Improvements

While building this project, I faced challenges in ensuring consistent styling across different browsers and devices. In the future, I plan to:

- Implement form validation for the reservation modal
- Add a backend to handle actual reservations
- Enhance accessibility features
- Optimize images for faster loading

This project has been a significant step in my web development journey, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world scenario. I'm excited to continue building on these skills in future projects!
